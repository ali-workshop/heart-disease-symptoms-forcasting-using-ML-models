# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using various machine learning algorithms. The prediction is based on clinical data obtained from patients. Accurate early detection can help medical professionals provide timely treatment and improve patient outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used contains several features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, electrocardiographic results, and other clinical attributes.

### Features

* Age
* Sex
* Chest pain type
* Resting blood pressure
* Cholesterol
* Fasting blood sugar
* Resting electrocardiographic results
* Maximum heart rate achieved
* Exercise-induced angina
* ST depression induced by exercise
* Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
* Thalassemia

### Target

* Presence or absence of heart disease (binary classification: 0 - no disease, 1 - disease)

## Algorithms Used

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Gradient Boosting

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Libraries:

  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * Scikit-learn
  * Seaborn

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
